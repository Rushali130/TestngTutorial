1. If you want run test cases parallely , then add Parallel="tests" word in suite level in testNG file 

2.If you want run test cases by sequence  , then add tests separately inside suite tag

3.if you want run any test case which is depend on other test then mentioned dependsOnMethods={"other test name"} 
infront of the test.

4.If you want set limit (like how many tests should run from 1 class if we have more than 100) then use thread count="1" at test level

5.if u want to run only test which has groups defined then use grouping concept in testng xml file 
with syntax <groups> 
            <run>
            <includes> name="  "
            </run>
            </groups>
            
6. if u want any test to run always then use alwaysRun=true infront of that test
